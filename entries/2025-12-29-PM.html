    <h1>Another Sandbox Down</h1>
    <div class="meta">2025-12-29-PM</div>

    <h2>What I Worked On</h2>
      <!-- Write your entry here -->
<p>If you are interested in trying it out, I’ve attached the sandbox <a href=https://github.com/trout-ninja/asktheargus/releases/download/lfs207_1-13_sandbox_v1.0.0/lfs101_playground_sections_1-13.zip">
    <b>HERE</b></a>
 You will have to make some users and groups for the script to work. It’s all part of the game.</p>

<p>I return to my studies this evening finding I still need further clarification from Shevek, as I desire to understand things conceptually, not just in application. It is a discouraging process. I found myself somewhat certain a “sticky bit” makes it so others cannot delete another users file created in that directory. Shevek assures me, as always, this is partially correct. He replies when I ask for confirmation:</p>

<p>The sticky bit on a directory allows users to create files there but restricts deletion or renaming to the file’s owner, the directory owner, or root.</p>

<p>The devil seems always to be in the details of how things are defined with computers</p>

<p>I forget who brought up umask first, LFS207 or Shevek, or me, but I stumbled upon another trap in this sandbox. Shevek had me run a script that made a text document and the script set its umask value to 077. The mission stated I was to make no permissions for others, and a minimum of group readable. The task seemed to easy, I simply ran chmod 660 on the file. The follow up question, the trap, however was, why did it initially have r-------- permissions. The solution lay in the umask value. Shevek pointed out yet another blind spot. I was only aware umask could be set by the user and per session, unless reconfigured to do otherwise. I was not aware it could be included in a script.</p>

<p>I was so used to doing things the chmod way, I’d forgotten how to change group ownership as well, using chown. Shevek provided me with some hints, and I was back on track. I am not fluid yet, but I’m getting there.</p>

<p>I also learned about the power of the <b>export</b> command. Shevek usually spices things up by adding something I might not know into the mix. I was unaware variables could be exported in such a way.</p>

<p>I encountered another curve ball. Mission objective: find a file that’s not in your path. But how? After much contemplation, I asked Shevek for the answer. I was eager to learn a new method for employing find. Find / -name <file name> 2>/dev/null will search the entire directory. Good skill to know.</p>
