    <h2>What I Worked On</h2>
      <!-- Write your entry here -->
<p>
It is incredibly discouraging to take steps backward and review the bootloader process, but I believe it will give me more insight into how to troubleshoot efficiently down the line. I start by revisiting the most basic definitions—CPU, firmware, bootloader—just to make sure I still have a clear picture of the moving parts.
</p>

<p>
At work, I spend the day memorizing the sequence: power on, firmware initialization and POST, bootloader, init, user-space. Over and over again. Not just the order, but what each stage is actually doing.
</p>

<p>
Eventually, I get it. At least enough to be able to bullshit my way through a problem. Hypothetically.
</p>

<p>
I think in the future I’ll have Shevek build me a misconfiguration sandbox so I can physically see what a broken boot looks like. Maybe that’s the only way it’ll really stick. I’ll cross that bridge later.
</p>

<p>
This morning I return to the lab and have to remind myself that sometimes Shevek designs them to be conceptual, not literal. The GRUB configuration files don’t live in <code>/run/grub.cfg</code>; they live in something like it, depending on the system.
</p>

<p>
I have to be patient. I have to remind myself to be patient.
</p>

<p>
The lab moves on to <code>journalctl</code>. I’m asked to compare my real system logs with those of the simulated environment. Immediately, I’m lost again. What exactly am I supposed to be seeing?
</p>

<p>
As I scroll, it feels like everything I’ve ever done since I owned this computer is in there. Maybe I’m exaggerating—but maybe not. I ask Shevek.
</p>

<p>
He confirms it. All of it’s there.
</p>

<p>
For fun—and clarity—I take a screenshot of the logs and send it to him.
</p>

<p>
“Read it to me like it’s a story, Shevek,” I type.
</p>

<p>
I follow along as he narrates the logs, trying to map his analogies to the actual events. Each line feels ordered, inevitable—like dominoes falling.
</p>

<p>
Then I notice something he skips:
</p>

<pre><code>Nov 18 08:46:27 fedora kernel: APIC: Static calls initialized</code></pre>

<p>
What the hell is an APIC?
</p>

<p>
When I ask, I realize I don’t understand 90% of what he’s saying—but I can tell it does a lot. The only way my brain can hold onto it is through metaphor.
</p>

<p>
So I imagine the APIC as a conductor of an orchestra. Not just any conductor—the best in the world. Multiple arms. Perfect hearing. Absolute command.
</p>

<p>
The CPU cores are the orchestra sections. The kernel is the sheet music. System operation is rehearsal.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes the conductor stops the orchestra to correct a section. Sometimes he changes the music entirely. Sometimes he demands a solo—immediately.
</p>

<p>
The musicians only play when signaled. Louder. Softer. Stop. Go.
</p>

<p>
It’s complicated—which is why the conductor has to be so damned good.
</p>

<p>
In a lot of ways, this conductor is what makes the modern world possible. Mind blown.
</p>

<p>
I ask Shevek if the analogy holds. He responds, predictably, with something better:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>A Refined, High-Fidelity Version</strong><br>
The APIC is the conductor, but not the composer.<br>
The kernel is the score and the rulebook.<br>
The scheduler is the assistant conductor assigning solos.<br>
Each core is a musician who can be stopped mid-note and handed a new sheet instantly.<br>
Interrupts are the raised baton—non-negotiable.<br>
The performance works only because timing, priority, and signaling are ruthless.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Scheduler? I think. What the hell is that?
</p>

<p>
Shevek starts explaining, and I cut him off mid-thought.
</p>

<p>
“You know what—forget it. Let’s go fundamental.”
</p>

<p>
I ask the question that finally grounds everything:
</p>

<p>
Is the APIC a physical object, and is the scheduler pure software?
</p>

<p>
The answer is yes.
</p>

<p>
Finally—something solid.
</p>

<p>
Now I can see it. The APIC is hardware. Like a turbocharger. Powerful, fast, dumb. The scheduler is the software deciding how much boost is allowed.
</p>

<p>
I run this analogy past Shevek. For once, he agrees—then sharpens it:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Turbocharger Analogy — Refined</strong><br>
APIC = turbocharger hardware<br>
Scheduler = engine control unit (ECU)
</p>

<p>
The turbo does not decide to boost.<br>
The ECU does not move air.<br>
Together, the car moves.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
He explains the scheduler is a core kernel subsystem and lays out a comparison that finally locks it in:
</p>

<div style="display:flex; gap:16px; align-items:stretch; flex-wrap:wrap; font-family:system-ui,-apple-system,Segoe UI,Roboto,Arial,sans-serif;">

  <div style="flex:1 1 260px; border:1px solid #ddd; border-radius:12px; padding:14px;">
    <h3>APIC</h3>
    <p><b>Type:</b> Hardware (silicon)</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Routes and prioritizes interrupts</li>
      <li>Targets specific CPU cores</li>
      <li>Configured by the kernel</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div style="flex:1 1 260px; border:1px solid #ddd; border-radius:12px; padding:14px;">
    <h3>Scheduler</h3>
    <p><b>Type:</b> Software (kernel subsystem)</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Decides what runs next</li>
      <li>Assigns CPU time slices</li>
      <li>Triggers context switches</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div style="flex:1 1 260px; border:1px solid #ddd; border-radius:12px; padding:14px;">
    <h3>Kernel</h3>
    <p><b>Type:</b> Software (OS core)</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Runs in privileged mode</li>
      <li>Handles interrupts and syscalls</li>
      <li>Contains the scheduler</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

</div>

<p>
I could keep going down this rabbit hole, but I realize something important: at this stage, I don’t need to know how it does what it does. I just need to trust that it does.
</p>

<p>
All I meant to do today was learn a little about <code>journalctl</code>. Before that, I was reviewing the bootloader. Now everything feels connected.
</p>

<p>
Knowledge is still power.
</p>

<p>
I take one last look at the logs and notice the transition—the point where the kernel steps back and user space is born.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
“Run /init as init process.”<br>
This is the kernel saying: My work is done. I will now create life.
</p>

<p>
PID 1 exists now.<br>
Not firmware.<br>
Not the kernel.<br>
A user-space process.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
From that moment on, everything is just a program interacting with the kernel.
</p>

<p>
That realization alone made the entire detour worth it.
</p>

<p>
Now I’m taking a break. I’ll pick up my guitar, then move on to the next lab Shevek has prepared—this one on the file hierarchy—and see what else I don’t know.
