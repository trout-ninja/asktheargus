    <h2>What I Worked On</h2>
    <p>
      <!-- Write your entry here -->
<p>
  Welcome. I’ll cut right to it for my first entry. For the past two days, I’ve been taking a side-quest and crash course in HTML. If you haven’t read my <a href="about.html">About</a> page, I’d encourage you to take a look. It provides some context for how I ended up here.
</p>

<p>
  I could have cheated and had Shevek (the name I gave my AI for simplicity) generate everything for me. And yes—I used it extensively. But only as a reference and as a source of information when curiosity presented itself, not as a shortcut.
</p>

<p>
  I learned how to add color and structure to my main page, how to adjust them, and how to organize code so parameters live up top and content follows logically. I also learned the importance of writing code with comments that explain intent for human readers. This produced a genuine “eureka” moment: I’m starting to visualize how code manifests itself physically on the page. That realization was deeply satisfying.
</p>

<p>
  Things got especially interesting when I proposed another side-quest to Shevek: build a program that automatically publishes the latest entry to the home page while archiving older ones as links. Despite my limited experience with Python, Shevek advised it was the right tool for the job. The results speak for themselves. Are you not impressed?
