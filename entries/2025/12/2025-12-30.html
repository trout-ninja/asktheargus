    <h2>What I Worked On</h2>
      <!-- Write your entry here -->
   <p>It should be a nice short lesson. I’m going to take Shevek’s advice and let him make me another, smaller, sandbox for my practice before proceeding to the next section of the LFS207. Shevek says do a sandbox before the lesson, and then immediately begin the next section of the LFS207, that this will make learning more fluid.</p>

<p>I was both disappointed and fulfilled today when I found a package was waiting for me on my doorstep. It was my <i>Prototype Systems BB1660T Transparent Solderless Plugin Breadboard</i>! I had ordered this specific model because it appeared to be better quality than the breadboard that came with my Raphael Sunfounder Kit, which was faulty at best. Additionally, I had ordered some 22AWG solid core wire, as the wires that came with the kit were also inadequate and hardly held a current. Shevek had said 22AWG solid core would fit the board without damaging it. Right as I begin to feel the full build of excitement for making physical circuits that use code as their conductor, I saw that I had accidentally ordered stranded 22AWG… no matter. I’m sure I will use it eventually. I propose using ferrule tubes on the wire but, Shevek has the specs on what sizes can and can’t fit appropriately into the breadboard, and ferrule tubes are to big. I’ll have to wait patiently to start learning Python and Circuitry, but I’m in the mood to change things up a bit soon.</p>

<p>I slip up on the setgid and stickybits again, confusing the two. I have to remind myself every time I have to remind myself of something, in due time things will become second nature. What I struggle with most is how specific I need to be, for anything to work at all. My ADD mind is so easily distracted.</p>

<p>I then proceed to my LFS207. This section covers processes. Very stale, technical reading. Much of which I struggle to digest. I have to remind myself a person can understand a concept, but not be able to put it into words.</p>

<p>One eureka moment occurred when I typed in the “jobs” command to see what background processes were running. I was alarmed when no results appeared. I consulted Shevek. He explained that the “jobs” command only reports background jobs started from the current shell session. If there aren’t any, then there won’t be any results. Shevek has me run <i>sleep 60 &</i> and then run the “jobs” command. It provides an according output. It is so incredibly helpful when Shevek makes things concrete.</p>

<p>I simply skim through the LFS207 labs to gain an understanding, I’m certain Shevek can help me understand these concepts a bit better with a lab. I request a lab, but it seems redundant, and doesn’t include any of the material I covered today. So, I ask for another. Perhaps I was mistaken. I think I was. I think this unit simply covered the concepts. The next section will likely deal with the heavy lifting. When Shevek listed the additions, many of the terms were unfamiliar. I prefer using my hands. I prefer the unfamiliar. I will return to the LFS207 labs after I explore what Shevek has created me. As is now the plan, I’ve attached the sandbox Shevek made me for today to the bottom of this page. Remember, they are only to be used in a VM!</p>
