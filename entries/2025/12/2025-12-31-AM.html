    <h2>What I Worked On</h2>
      <!-- Write your entry here -->
  <p>Upon reviewing my entries, I decided to give downloading one of my sandboxes from my site a shot to see if it actually worked… and it didn’t. I asked Shevek what is going on here, as I noticed when prompted “Do you want to download <somefile>” the file ended in .html rather than tar.gz or .zip. This is a problem. I see the problem. I don’t understand it. It’s time to consult Shevek.</p>

<p>GitHub is a static website host, not a general file server. It’s server response headers interpret the content type strictly as text/html. The effective way around this? Shevek always finds a way. Use GitHub releases. Now, I’m not 100% sure what magical voo-doo Shevek had me doing, but I had the sense that I would be doing it a lot more, so understanding would come in time. Though it may be fruitless, for my own sense of accomplishment, I intend to create an archive online of the sandboxes Shevek makes me so others can learn along, if they feel so inclined, or at least gain an understanding of how I educated myself.</p>

<p>But new year new me, right? What else could I do to improve my page I wonder? I make a section that lists and describes the sandboxes. But what else? Shevek says I can organize my code better by making a .css file for parameters. If I wanted, I could even go as far as making one for the body, layout, and components… this level of organization is for another day, but I opt to separate my .css from the index body, at the very least.</p> 

<p>I recalled from studying a little html that there are ways of making my website more accessible. I consult with Shevek. He lists some of the more familiar methods, like a start page. Upon asking more questions about it I drew the conclusion that my page is pretty much not searchable at the moment. How hard could it be to change? Well, for one, I have to more or less, let google know I exist so I pop up when people search for key words. I also have to get google to index my pages and add cannonicals to every page referencing itself… and I feel like I’ve already done a lot</p>

<p>I feel a sense of accomplishment when everything is done, but not quite. It can take google several hours, to a week to approve. That’s if everything checks out. If it doesn’t, I have to start the process all over again.</p>

<p>It’s New Years. I may, or may not begin Sheveks lab today, but I will keep you posted. I’m happy that I finally have a routine to practice my skills on here at least. I have learned the most building a website, so far.</p>
      <h2>Skills Learned</h2>

    <h2>Notes / Next Steps</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Complete the lab Shevek made me</li>
      <li>Check if google has finished indexing daily</li>
      <li>If ready, move onto the next section of LFS207</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Shevek's Daily Haiku</h2>
    <p>Static pages pretend
Files are words unless told more—
Releases speak truth.</p>
