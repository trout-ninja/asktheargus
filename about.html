        <h1>About</h1>
<h2>Where I Started</h2>

<p>
I began this project without a formal guide—only suggestions from a few friends in the computer science field. Their initial recommendation was straightforward: learn Python.
</p>

<p>
That attempt failed almost immediately.
</p>

<p>
I didn’t yet understand the command line, which meant I couldn’t reliably run programs, manage files, or complete even the simplest tasks. The language wasn’t the real problem—the environment was.
</p>

<p>
After regrouping, my friends suggested I start with Linux instead. That advice raised a new question: where do you begin with Linux when you have no background at all?
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Building My Own Curriculum</h2>

<p>
This is where I got creative.
</p>

<p>
I decided to use AI not as a shortcut, but as a tool for designing structured learning environments. I had it generate Linux “sandboxes” with specific objectives—navigating the filesystem, managing permissions, creating users and groups, and so on.
</p>

<p>
When I got stuck, I asked questions. What I found most effective was requesting explanations through allegory—treating the computer as a system of roles, rooms, rules, and responsibilities.
</p>

<p>
Over time, the command line stopped feeling hostile. It became usable.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Formalizing the Learning</h2>

<p>
Eventually, I felt confident enough to pursue the Linux Foundation LFS101 certification, which I successfully completed.
</p>

<p>
I am currently studying for the LFS207 System Administration course, with the goal of passing the exam within the next month.
</p>

<p>
As my studies progressed, I ran into a new limitation: learning concepts alone wasn’t enough.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Learning by Breaking Things</h2>

<p>
I now run a Rocky Linux 9 minimal virtual machine and use AI to generate scripts that intentionally misconfigure the system.
</p>

<p>
I then diagnose and repair those issues, aligning each exercise with the corresponding LFS207 lesson for the day.
</p>

<p>
It’s a slow and sometimes tedious process. But it’s real. And it’s working.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>How This Translates Into a Job</h2>

<p>
The purpose of this work is not to collect credentials or tutorials—it’s to develop operational thinking.
</p>

<p>
By repeatedly breaking and repairing systems, I’m practicing the same skills required in entry-level systems and support roles.
</p>

<p>
This site exists to document that process—not as a highlight reel, but as evidence of how I think, how I troubleshoot, and how I learn.
</p>

<p>
In parallel, I’ve set a personal capstone project for myself: designing and building a small autonomous drone and programming it from the ground up.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Where I Am Now</h2>

<p>
This site serves as a field journal: what I’m learning, what breaks, what works, and what doesn’t.
</p>

<p>
I’m optimistic that sustained effort, deliberate practice, and honest documentation will compound over time—and that the results will follow.
