  <h1>Start Here</h1>

  <p>
    Ask the Argus is a public self-education journal documenting a
    hands-on path into Linux, coding, and systems thinking.
  </p>

  <p>
    This site is not a tutorial farm or a highlight reel.
    It is a record of real learning: experiments, mistakes,
    sandboxes, and reflection.
  </p>

  <h2>What This Site Is About</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Learning Linux from the command line up</li>
    <li>Understanding systems, permissions, and workflows</li>
    <li>Using structured sandboxes to learn by doing</li>
    <li>Documenting the self-education process honestly</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How to Use This Site</h2>

  <p>
    If you are new here, start with recent journal entries.
    Each entry builds understanding through practice rather than theory alone.
  </p>

  <p>
    Many posts reference Linux Foundation coursework (such as LFS207),
    but the lessons apply broadly to anyone learning Linux or coding independently.
